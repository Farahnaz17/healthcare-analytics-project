 Mock Healthcare Data – Capstone Project

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data analysis process using a synthetic healthcare dataset (mock data only, no PHI). It simulates real-world challenges like appointment no-shows, revenue tracking, and patient volume trends, allowing me to showcase SQL, Excel, and Tableau skills.




 1. Ask

Problem Statement:
High patient no-show rates and inconsistent revenue collection negatively impact healthcare operations. Understanding patient appointment behavior and billing trends can help reduce inefficiencies and improve patient care.

Guided Questions:

1. What are the trends in appointment attendance (completed, cancelled, no-show) over time?


2. How do patient demographics and insurance type impact revenue and appointment outcomes?


3. Which provider specialties and appointment types drive the highest patient volume and charges?





 2. Prepare

Created synthetic datasets: Patients, Appointments, Providers, Billing.

Ensured dataset was clean, consistent, and de-identified.

Structured into relational tables for analysis.





3. Process

Cleaned missing values and standardized categories in Excel.

Normalized data with primary/foreign keys in SQL.

Joined tables for cross-functional analysis.




 4. Analyze

SQL queries calculated no-show rates, revenue trends, and insurance breakdowns.

Excel pivot tables provided summary statistics.

Tableau dashboards visualized patient volume, demographics, and billing efficiency.





 5. Share

Insights Uncovered:

 No-show rates averaged 18%, with spikes on Mondays and in winter months.

 Private insurance patients generated the highest revenue, while uninsured patients had larger unpaid balances.

 Primary Care & Pediatrics accounted for the largest share of appointments.

Patient volume showed seasonality, peaking during flu season (fall/winter).

 6. Act

Takeaways & Next Steps:

Clear visual storytelling made trends actionable for stakeholders.

Recommended reminder interventions (calls/texts) to reduce no-shows.

Suggested analyzing insurance coverage mix for financial planning.


Future Improvements:

Expand dataset to include clinical outcomes.

Apply predictive modeling to forecast no-shows and revenue.

Automate workflows with Python/dbt for scalability.
