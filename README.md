**Healthcare Operations**

Project Overview

This project simulates a healthcare dataset to analyze patient outcomes, revenue trends, and operational efficiency. The goal is to uncover insights that can help healthcare administrators make data-driven decisions.

üéØ Problem Statement

What patterens in patient attendance, appointment types, and revenue can be uncovered to help reduce no-sho ratesand improve overall healthcare operaions efficiency?

3 Guided Questions:







**Tools & Data**

Data Source: Mock healthcare dataset simulating patient visits 
Tools Used: SQL, Tableau, Excel

Key Variables:

patient_id ‚Äì unique patient identifier

visit_date / check_in_time / check_out_time

appointment_type ‚Äì e.g., consultation, follow-up

no_show ‚Äì patient attendance status

revenue ‚Äì payment received




Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed duplicate and incomplete records

Converted timestamps into day, month, and visit duration

Standardized appointment types and patient categories

Aggregated revenue and no-show metrics for analysis



**Analyze & Share**


Analysis & Insights

Key Questions Answered:

1. What are peak patient volumes by day/week/month?


2. Which appointment types have the highest no-show rates?


3. How does revenue trend over time?


4. What factors correlate with patient attendance?



Insights:

No-shows are higher for certain appointment types and days

Peak patient load occurs on mid-week mornings

Revenue trends align closely with patient volume

Operational bottlenecks can be identified for process improvement

**Deliverables**

Cleaned SQL tables for patient and revenue analysis

Tableau dashboards visualizing trends and operational metrics

Insights report highlighting recommendations for administrators


**Act**


**Recommendations**

Implement reminder notifications for high-risk no-show appointments

Optimize staffing schedules during peak hours

Focus on appointment types with higher revenue potential

Use data-driven scheduling to reduce patient wait times



**What I Would Do Differently**

Include patient demographics to better understand patterns

Integrate insurance type and payment data for revenue analysis

Predict no-shows using machine learning models

Conduct longitudinal studies for patient retention
